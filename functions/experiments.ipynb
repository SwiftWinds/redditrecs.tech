Some guis hide complexity sure, but they can also improve visibility to the internal state of the repo, which makes learning git way easier. This is where they really shine in my opinion. Github desktop is a poor example, look instead to Gitkraken, Fork, or Sourcetree. All of them provide feedback on how your actions affect your commits and the state of your repo that's hard to get on the CLI alone.\\n\\nTake the question of rebase vs merge for example. It's a question beginners ask a lot, even though they're pretty different in terms of what they do. It's hard to give a precise beginner-friendly verbal explanation of the difference, in part because any verbal explanation of a git thing is bound to be extremely jargon-heavy, but it's extremely obvious how they're different by just trying both and watching what they do to the graph.\", 'score': 1, 'author': 'axosoft-chuckd', 'replies': []}]}}\n",
